                              <p>Being more of a non-verbal unit, Publicity Unit of the fellowship is a unit that is outstanding in multi-various works and can be regarded as a ministerial unit entirely as there is Evangelism in Publicity. Glory to Jesus for numerous and wonderful ideas he has been blessing us with because without him it will be hard to tell the public what is needed at the right time.</p>

                                <p>We work hand in hand with other units as we handle; diverse publications of the fellowship in different forms like Monthly Bulletin, Sunday School Pamphlet, Magazines, Banners, Posters among many others using design software like CorelDRAW, Photoshop, e.t.c. as well as using creativity in designing and binding Bibles, cutting of Lettering, making sketches, and drawing cartoons and all of these indicate our oneness. So much can be derived from the unit in that there are lots to be learnt and acquired knowledge-wise.</p>

                                
                                <p>Finally amidst members, love and unity abound which enhance the fulfilment of our goal and purpose.</p>
