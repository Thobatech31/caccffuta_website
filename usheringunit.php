                                <h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE UNIT</h3>
                                <P><b>The concept of an Usher is not new. In the Old Testaments, there were positions addressed asDoor Keepers or Gate Keepers and their roles were very similar (2 Kings 22:4; Chronicles 9:17-27; Psalms 84:10).</b></P>
                                    <p>Jesus disciples can be considered Ushers in the sense that they Prepared the way for Jesus; Kept order among those listening to Christ, Serve foods to the audience,Cleaning up after a service such as after the feeding of the Five thousand.</p>
  
                                <h3><b>In CACCF, the Fellowship Ushers have many duties depending on the Churchs denomination, size and Preference. Ushers may perform all, some, or a few of the following.</b></h3>
                              <p>Welcome people entering the Fellowship.</p>
                              <p>Seat Attendees.</p>
                              <p>Collect the Tithes and Offerings.</p>
                              <p>Disseminate information to members during the Service.</p>
                              <p>Keep order at the entrance.</p>
                              <p>Clean and Prepare the Fellowship.</p>
                              <p>Distribute bulletins and Service Programmes.</p>
                              <p>Look out for the Pastor or Visiting Speakers.</p>

                              <p>Ushers are required to be punctual and time conscious as they are expected to be in Church far earlier than the rest of the Congregation. Adequate Spiritual Preparation by the Usher ensures a service full of the presence of God</p>

                              <h3>CHRISTIAN LIVING</h3>
                              <p>Ushers, as the ones who stand at the door, greet and distribute pamphlets, can be considered as an Ambassador for the Church and a key part in the Body of Christ.</p>
                              <p>The role is supposed to continue long after the church had adjourned. The life of an Usher should be an example of Christian living in everyday life.</p>
                              <p>Daily conduct should be in line with the word of Christians, God, the Bible and the Ministry of Jesus.
</p>
                              <p>Ushers are servants of God that minister Life to people through the word of their mouth (Word of God), character (Christ like) and their lives.</p>
                              <p>Ushers need to be sensitive in His house and everywhere he/she may find himself/herself not as figurehead in the presence of God.</p>
