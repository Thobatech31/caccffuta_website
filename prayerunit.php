                              <p>Thanks to the Lord that called us as ambassador in His vineyard, praise the Lord. Prayer unit is a place to be because it is a unit that sharpens ones destiny. <BR/>The unit members are intercessor that carry the burden of the church to the presence of God, and also deliver the mind of God to the church. The bible says that pray ceaselessly, this mean that we should pray at all times If You are not a prayer man then you will be a prey to the devil. Prayer is what you cannot do without in your Christian life, A man of prayer rules his world Prayer controls the physical in the spiritual realm. So prayer is inevitable in our life.</p>
