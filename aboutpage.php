                            <h2>HISTORY OF THE FELLOWSHIP</h2>
                              <p>The Christ Apostolic Church Campus Fellowship was established in the year 1985 by undergraduates that had vision of bringing together CAC students on campus. Though the fellowship started out as CAC Students Association (CACSA), the fellowship currently bears the name-CHRIST APOSTOLIC CHURCH CAMPUS FELLOWSHIP. It was so named, by the initiative of the staff advisers then, to avoid unnecessary differences among students who wish to join a students CAC fellowship.</p>

                              <p>The beginning of the fellowship was indeed humble as the fellowship held her service at different locations in the school premises, ranging from the Great Hall to Big LT, before the fellowship acquired her own site. The procuring of a new site was prompted by an issue between the schools security officers and some students Christian body on campus, which impelled the school authority to ban all religious activities in the school premises and centralise the worship centres for both Christians and Muslims. The procurement of the current site for worship is yet another tale; spiced by the relentless efforts of giants in the past whose selfless services cannot be forgotten.</p>

                              <p>The fellowship used to have as her president a 300 level member which was later changed after reasonable considerations to a 500 level member. The leadership of the fellowship has since inception been transitional since it is a students setting. And the mode of choosing has been by the leading of the Holy Spirit through a critically setup committee, the transition committee; which is done in every academic session.</p>

                              <p>The fellowship has affiliations with CAC worldwide â€“ the mother church, but isindependent of any factions thereof; and in the same line, a very strong member of theNational Joint Campus Fellowship of CAC which is in pursuit of the unity of CAC worldwide.</p>

                              <p>The fellowship has since been committed to some engagement like evangelical outreaches, securing a plot of land being used for business venture to finance the fellowship, among others. And ever since the inception of the fellowship, the population has been increasing as days go by.</p>
