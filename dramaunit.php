                                <h3>THE TRIUMPHANT DRAMA FAMILY CACCF FUTA VISION</h3>
                             
                                    <p>Our vision as a body of Christ is to reach out to people, the word of God through drama according to Colossians 3:16 which say let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom. The triumphant Drama family brings to the heart of people the true word of God. A platform where people can see the word of God in action and have it stay with them for a long period of time or even for the rest of their lives is established.</p>

                                    <p>The triumphant drama family has also come together in order to fight against the devices of the devil by revealing to the world, the secrets of the world of darkness through drama and to set those in captivity free. Obadiah 1:17 says but upon mount Zion shall be deliverance and there shall be holiness and the house of Jacob shall possess there possession. Our vision is to ensure that people regain whatever they have lost to the enemy through any means and live to fulfill their purpose of destiny.</p>

                                    <p>God has being helping the triumphant drama family and we want to show it to the world that the standard of the lord does not change. There is a level that the lord wants us to measure up to before we can live in his kingdom which we call the kingdom of lifestyle. Our lifestyle must be the type that Jesus Christ leaved while he was on earth. Others must see Jesus in us before can say we are leaving the kingdom lifestyle.</p>
